# Human adenovirus typing database
Typing of human adenovirus is based on [nucleotide identity] (https://journals.asm.org/doi/10.1128/JVI.00354-11) in the penton, hexon and fiber regions. References were obtained from [ICTV] (https://ictv.global/report/chapter/adenoviridae/adenoviridae/mastadenovirus) and [HAdV Working Group] (http://hadvwg.gmu.edu/). Currently there are 113 recognized human adenovirus types. 52 of them are non-recombinant, including 51 [original types] (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7171713/) and [HAdV-G52] (https://journals.asm.org/doi/full/10.1128/JVI.02650-06).
